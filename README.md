# Gray to BCD Converter Using Arduino

## Overview
This project implements a 2-bit Gray code to Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) converter using an Arduino board. It includes Arduino source code along with the circuit designed and tested on Tinkercad, an online electronics simulation platform.

## Features
- Converts 2-bit Gray code inputs to corresponding BCD output
- Implemented using Arduino UNO
- Circuit simulation performed on Tinkercad for validation
- Easy to understand Arduino code for educational and prototyping purposes

## Files Included
- `GRAY2BCDARDUINO.ino` : Arduino sketch for Gray to BCD conversion
- Circuit simulation link (see below)

## How to Use
1. Upload `GRAY2BCDARDUINO.ino` to your Arduino Uno.
2. Provide Gray code inputs via digital pins (as per setup).
3. Observe BCD outputs on connected LEDs or serial monitor.
4. Refer to the Tinkercad circuit simulation for wiring and verification.
